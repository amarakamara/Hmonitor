          <p>
            Temperature is a fundamental indicator of health, and deviations
            from the norm can provide insight into underlying conditions.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Low Temperature:</h4>
          <p>
            Temperature reading below 35째C may suggest hypothermia, a condition
            characterized by dangerously low body temperature, potentially
            leading to confusion, shivering, and drowsiness.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold  mt-2 mb-1">Normal Temperature:</h4>
          <p>
            Normal body temperature typically falls within a narrow range,
            indicating a balanced state of health. For most individuals, a
            temperature reading between 35째C and 38째C is considered normal.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">High Temperature:</h4>
          <p>
            A temperature exceeding 38째C could indicate fever, often a sign of
            infection or illness, prompting the body to elevate its temperature
            to combat pathogens

          <h2 className="mt-4 mb-1 font-bold text-xl">Heart Rate:</h2>
          <p>
            Heart Rate, the measure of heartbeats per minute, offers valuable
            insights into cardiovascular health.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Low Heart Rate:</h4>
          <p>
            heart rate below 60 beats per minute may signify bradycardia, where
            the heart beats slower than normal, possibly causing dizziness,
            fatigue, or fainting.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Normal Heart Rate:</h4>
          <p>
            a normal heart rate reflects the heart's ability to pump blood
            effectively throughout the body, maintaining circulation and
            delivering oxygen and nutrients to vital organs. In adults, a heart
            rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is generally
            considered normal at rest
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">High Heart Rate:</h4>
          <p>
            a heart rate surpassing 120 beats per minute could indicate
            tachycardia, characterized by a rapid heartbeat, potentially
            signaling stress, dehydration, or an underlying heart condition.
